I changed the drum kit project to a "vaporwave mixer" with related content, changed the key-data from letters to numerics, and altered some of the styles. First I uploaded this to Code.Pen, but it was blocking 3rd party .wav and .gif content, so I decided to move the project to Github and upload the .wav and .gif files to a local folder here. Then the JS wasn't running, so I spent some time debugging and setting up Github Pages. 

## Day 2
### [Messier 87 Black Hole Clock](https://codepen.io/bitpixi/pen/VNrdOx)

I fixed the "rewind" bug by shortening the CSS transition time. I also changed the clock hands to thicker and thinner levels to differentiate between hours, minutes, and seconds. Then I changed the hands to match the circle by replicating the white with bezzle style in moderately proportional ratios. Finally, I added a background from topical meme culture about the M87 Black Hole to create a contrasting background.
