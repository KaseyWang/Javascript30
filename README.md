I changed the drum kit project to a "vaporwave mixer" with related content, changed the key-data from letters to numerics, and altered some of the styles. First I uploaded this to Code.Pen, but it was blocking 3rd party .wav and .gif content, so I decided to move the project to Github and upload the .wav and .gif files to a local folder here.
